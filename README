This is the source code for my automator/driver for the Gamma Scientific flexOptometer. Just started,
already allows the automated collection of data and saving to a text (CSV) file.

The use case is the measurement of watch luminosity, see 

http://watchotaku.com/display/swr/Measure+luminosity

Hardware requirements:
* flexOptometer http://www.gamma-sci.com/products/flexOptometer.html with sensor, filter(s), etc
* Dark environment/sample chamber. See http://watchotaku.com/display/swr/Build+a+UV+watch+illuminator

Software requirements:
* Python
* Twisted
* FTDI serial-over-usb driver
* (Soon, I hope) veusz for plotting http://home.gna.org/veusz/
* pyserial module

Project status:
* Code works now! 
* Command-line configurable sample delay, data directory and filename. (also serial port, baud rate, etc) 
* Now writing a simple metadata file header (timestamp, units, copyright, url)

Planned features:
* Live plotting, curve fits and extrapolation to no-longer-readable threshold.

Next steps:
* Re-run reference watches with new datafile and sampling code, & upload to github.
