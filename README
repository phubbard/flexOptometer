This is the source code for my automator/driver for the Gamma Scientific flexOptometer. Just started,
already allows the automated collection of data and saving to a text (CSV) file.

The use case is the measurement of watch luminosity, see 

http://watchotaku.com/display/swr/Measure+luminosity

Hardware requirements:
* flexOptometer http://www.gamma-sci.com/products/flexOptometer.html with sensor, filter(s), etc
* Dark environment/sample chamber. See http://watchotaku.com/display/swr/Build+a+UV+watch+illuminator

Software requirements:
* Python
* Twisted
* FTDI serial-over-usb driver
* (Soon, I hope) veusz for plotting http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Project status:
* Code works now. Connects, sets up continuous sampling at the default 5Hz, timestamps and logs all samples
  as tab-delimited text. Good enough for now.

Planned features:
* Add header and units to datafiles
* Move datafiles to data directory, so that I can use github to host my data and share it.
* Manual sampling at configurable rates. 5Hz is probably 10x too fast, really.
* Live plotting, curve fits and extrapolation to no-longer-readable threshold.
